# React Budget Allocation App

## Overview

Welcome to the React Budget Allocation App! In this project, I created a React Budget Allocation app to help manage and allocate a budget efficiently. Throughout this project, I learned how to break down a user interface into React components, became familiar with state management using the Context API, and explored the concepts of actions, reducers, and the dispatch function. I also gained experience in creating, saving, and editing code files to implement changes in the app.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The app is built using React components, providing a modular and maintainable structure.
- **State Management**: Utilize the Context API for efficient state management across the app.
- **Actions and Reducers**: Implement actions and reducers to handle state changes in a predictable manner.
- **Budget Allocation**: Add, edit, and delete budget items to manage your finances effectively.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The app provides real-time updates to budget changes, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/venkatesh-reddi/react_budget_app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd react_budget_app
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Set Budget**: Define your overall budget for allocation.
- **Increase or Decrease Budget**: Adjust the budget amounts as needed.
- **Choose Currencies**: Select from different available currencies.
- **Bulk Allocation**: Allocate the budget in bulk to various departments.
- **Individual Allocation**: Allocate the budget to individual departments directly in the table.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API**: For state management.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how to break down a UI into reusable React components.
- Managing state effectively using the Context API.
- Implementing actions and reducers for predictable state changes.
- Gaining hands-on experience in creating, saving, and editing code files.
